WHOSTHAT is a game entirely developed by me using the C programming language and the Windows API. The objective of the game is to guess the names of displayed celebrities.
Players can request hints or skip a celebrity; however, these actions, along with submitting an incorrect answer, will result in a loss of points.
The number of points deducted or awarded varies depending on the number of rounds in the game. This also determines the points earned for each correct answer.
